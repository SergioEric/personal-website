          "May 11, 2021 - March 30, 2022: I worked as a UI/UX designer for Keller Offers (https://kw.com), where I contributed to the development of their transactional portal. This project involved extensive design flow and graphical components, where I had the opportunity to propose user experience ideas reflected in the UI designs. I also worked as a Frontend Developer making changes to their commercial website and building a web application to display 'Cash Offers' results to the public; all of which was constructed using Next.js, React, and CSS.",
          'April 2022 - July 2022: As a frontend developer, I joined Customela (https://customela.com), a product of the company. Customela is an application that digitally transforms the entire process of creating, managing, and distributing contracts. In this application, I built the foundational layout, components, theming (light/dark), and responsive design using React/JavaScript, CSS with Emotion, and MUI (Material-UI). I also established the core logic that integrates the editor (where contract templates are created) with the internal workflow involved in creating clauses and models.',
          'July 2022 - September 2022: As a frontend developer, I began alongside a backend colleague to build a task bank for RXR (https://rxr.com/) called TaskBank. Our challenge was to develop a portal from scratch where they could create and manage the internal workflow of tasks for specific departments. We had three months to complete this system. In this project, we developed the web application using the Next.js/React stack and MUI (Material-UI) for design and components.',
          "October 2022 - December 2022: I did layout and component construction for Mobili, a real estate management app by Joonik, using React, MUI, and Redux. I built the new version/design for Financar's commercial website (financar.com.co) with React and MUI, and rejoined Customela to fix layout/component errors and build a significant portion of the landing page.",
          'January 2023 - April 2023: I rejoin Customela.com and begin refactoring UI components and building new views and flows throughout the application.',
          'May 2023 - August 2023: I joined Canary Clean on the frontend side, where the project was already initiated but not yet launched to the public. This project aims to provide a platform for offering domestic cleaning services. It is a traditional monolith built with PHP/Laravel and Livewire, with React integrated. My tasks involved fixing functionality issues, layout adjustments, and even some PHP work. This project concluded with the delivery of an MVP ready to attract its first users.',
          'September 2023 - December 2023: I began working on the Mobili project, a real estate management platform built with React and PHP/Laravel. Here, we developed a new module to manage resources (images, videos, and virtual tours) of properties on the platform. Subsequently, we built a new MVP application to manage internal cases/tasks related to properties. Previously, these processes were managed through channels like WhatsApp or other tools unsuitable for management purposes. This new application was named Mobilihd (Mobili Help Desk).',
          'January 2024 - February 2024: We continued working on and refining Mobilihd. In this new system, we create cases and tasks related to everything involving the real estate agency Financar, its properties, and relationships with clients. We focused on integrating GPT for idea generation, which formulates ideas using specific data such as descriptions, tasks, and corresponding responsibilities. This process creates a prompt that returns a structure enabling us to generate new tasks based on AI-generated ideas.',
          "March 2024 - April 2024: I was tasked with building the company website for Joonik (https://joonik.com). I was provided with the design in Figma and various resources for its development. We evaluated different frameworks to decide on a CMS and which libraries would be helpful. Ultimately, we chose Astro.build for its versatility in building static websites. The website was developed without frameworks like React or Vue, and without CSS frameworks, meaning it was a completely 'vanilla' development approach. We completed the website in 3 weeks. Additionally, we integrated Firebase (functions and Firestore) to store contact data from visitors and job applicants.",
          'May 2024 - June 2024: We began developing additional functionalities for Mobilihd and enhancing the system. On the design side, we worked on a new identity for the system, gradually developing it to provide a better look and feel to the system.',
          'October 2024 - May 2025: I joined "JDI" team, a platform that shows "KPIs" to clients (branches) about sales and/or services of car dealerships. The platform is full of graphs/tables and specific components for displaying monetary values, in said project I build a wide variety of them, also layouts, animations for specific components, all this following the provided design line.',
          'June 2025 - August 2025: "Legacy Architects" (https://legacysystem.com/) is a client from years ago that returns to joonik with problems on the platform, "legacy app" allows lawyers to plan, manage, and organize the entire legacy of families. In the short time of intervention that I had in the project, I was able to solve problems with front-end and backend, fix old functionalities (align them to how they should have worked in the first place) and add new ones.',
          'September 2025 - October 2025: I rejoin Mobili HD, where the design has changed completely, now with a well-established figma concept, I have the task of developing/implementing a large number of views in components. To carry out this task I rely on models like Claude Sonnet 4, MCP from figma and using github copilot - the result was fantastic, especially considering the time in which it was done.',
